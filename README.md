# FIRST Team 1699's 2016 Code Repository

We are currently transitioning from LabView to Java. 

Look in other repositories for archive code.

This repository currently contains the basic code for running our 2016 robot.

Please see control requirements.md for information about what our robot will do this year.

This version of the code requires Apache Commons and Apache Commons IO. This has not been tested on a roboRIO.
