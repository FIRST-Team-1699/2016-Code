# 2016-Code

We are currently transitioning from LabView to Java. 

This version of the code requires Apache Commons IO. This has been tested and works, follow the instructions in setup.md, (which also sets up lang3 and math3, they are optional and not utilized by the code, but may at a later date).

You can find this robot's results on [The Blue Alliance](http://www.thebluealliance.com/team/1699/2016).
