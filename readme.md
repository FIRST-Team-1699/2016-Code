# FIRST Team 1699's 2016 Code Repository

We are currently transitioning from LabView to Java. 

Look in other repositories for archive code.

This repository currently contains the code for running our 2016 robot.

Please see requirements.md for information about what our robot will do this year.

This version of the code requires Apache Commons IO. This has been tested and works, follow the instructions in setup.md, (which also sets up lang3 and math3, they are optional and not utilized by the code, but may at a later date).
